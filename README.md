# Prompt-Analysis -Tool

Introduction to Prompt Analysis Tool is a web application that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to analyze chat prompts and provide a score based on specific parameters. This tool allows users to enter a chat prompt and receive a score on a scale of 1 to 100, indicating how well the prompt satisfies certain criteria set by the system. Additionally, the tool generates a new prompt that meets all the specified parameters.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly web-based tool for analyzing chat prompts using OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5 Turbo language model. The tool helps users ensure that their prompts are clear, and specific, and effectively communicate the desired context and instructions. By scoring and generating new prompts, users can improve the effectiveness of their interactions with the language model.

## Features

*   Input OpenAI API Key: Users need to provide their OpenAI API key to access the language model's capabilities. The API key is hidden behind a password input field for added security.
    
*   Analyze Chat Prompt: Users can input a chat prompt, which may include system and user instructions, explicit cues, and other context information.
    
*   Prompt Scoring: The tool analyzes the given chat prompt and assigns a score from 1 to 100 based on specific parameters. The scoring criteria include clarity, specificity, context provision, and more.
    
*   Generate New Prompt: If the initial prompt does not meet all the required parameters, the tool generates a new prompt that satisfies the criteria.
